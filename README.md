## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - React server development Tool
- [Icons](https://https://lucide.dev/) - for icon

### What I learned
Styling with TaildwindCSS for the first time by building a Project was a challenge but i have the concepts.

React Context for making Components Props globally available through the creation of custom hooks, e.g i created useCart context for using count, items and other methods from the cart.

Use Location from react-router-dom to receive data from one component to another, like i did implement it at the level of receiving Product's data to the Product display page.

### Continued development

React Routing
React advanced Hooks.
Responsive Design (TailwindCss and CSS)
